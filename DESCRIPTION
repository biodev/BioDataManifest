Description: This package has two main functions.  It can render a Biomedical Data Manifest HTML
    file from either an Excel File as output from Microsoft Forms or functions as an aggregator
    to retrieve similar data from dbGap and the Genomic Data Commons.  Each Biomedical Data Manifest 
    provides a summary of a particular dataset both in terms of composition  as well as any ethical, 
    legal and social information that can be gathered.
Depends: R (>= 4.3.1), GenomicDataCommons
