			</div>
			<div class="col-md-6 border">
				This dataset contains a collection of cancer imaging data aimed at predicting the clinical response versus non-response to treatment in patients with various types of cancer. The images were obtained from multiple sources, including CT scans, MRIs, and PET scans, with labeled annotations on treatment response. The dataset provides the opportunity for researchers to develop machine learning models to predict treatment efficacy, supporting personalized medicine and better clinical decision-making.<br>

				<strong>Description of the data collection methodology:</strong> Data Sources: Data were obtained from multiple hospitals and cancer centers specializing in oncology treatments. This includes electronic health records (EHR), medical imaging archives, and genomic sequencing data.
Collection Techniques: Imaging data were collected during routine clinical visits at pre-specified timepoints (baseline, post-treatment, follow-up). Clinical data were sourced from EHRs, and genomic data were collected via whole-exome sequencing during routine cancer treatment workflows.

				<strong>Dataset Curation:</strong> Manual Curation: Imaging features (e.g., tumor size, shape, and texture) were manually extracted by radiologists from CT and MRI images. These features were then used as input variables for predictive models.
Clinical Data Curation: Patient clinical records were manually reviewed by a team of clinicians to ensure accuracy in variables such as tumor stage, treatment regimens, and response classification.
Automated Feature Extraction: For genomic data, mutations were identified using bioinformatics pipelines. These features were automatically extracted and curated based on predefined algorithms for mutation discovery and variant annotation.

				<strong>Guidelines for determining label values:</strong> Responder/Non-Responder Classification: The determination is based on tumor size changes measured by MRI or CT scan according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.
Responder: ≥30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions.
Non-Responder: <30% decrease, stable disease, or progression.

				<strong>Details of software used for generating labels:</strong> The OncoAI Platform was used for initial tumor segmentation and response prediction based on imaging data. This software uses deep learning algorithms to detect and quantify tumor regions, and the output is integrated with clinical data to classify treatment response.

				<strong>Labels with corresponding gold-standard benchmarks or proxies:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Responder vs Non-Responder were evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) as well as expert pathologists who reviewed histopathology slides to confirm tumor response at the cellular level.</li>
					</ul>

			<div class="col-md-6 border">
				<strong>Rater agreement/disagreement:</strong> Rater Agreement: The concordance between radiologists and pathologists in labeling treatment response was evaluated using Cohen’s kappa coefficient, which showed a 0.85 agreement, indicating strong consistency across raters.
Disagreements: In cases of rater disagreement, the labels were reviewed by a senior clinician for final determination.

					<li><strong>Number of dataset versions or releases currently available:</strong> 3</li>
					
					<li><strong>More versions expected?:</strong> Yes</li>
					
					
					<li><strong>Description of versions or releases:</strong>
						<ul>
<li><strong>Version 1.0 (March 2023):</strong> The initial release, which included basic demographic and imaging data for 500 patients treated for a specific condition. Only clinical and radiological features were included at this stage.</li>
<li><strong>Version 2.0 (July 2024):</strong> This version expanded the dataset to include clinical follow-up data, patient treatment regimens, and post-treatment imaging, along with a refined classification of patient responses to treatment (e.g., responder/non-responder). New imaging modalities, such as CT scans, were added.</li>
<li><strong>Version 3.0 (January 2025):</strong> The most recent update, adding data from an additional 300 patients and including new genomic data, such as biomarker levels and sequencing results. Labeling has been updated for several cases based on feedback from clinical experts. Additional machine learning-derived features have also been incorporated.</li>
</ul>

					</li>
					
					
					<li><strong>Future updates:</strong>
						<ul>
<li><strong>Genomic Data</strong>: Genomic data, such as biomarkers and sequencing results, are not expected to change frequently. Once new markers are identified, they will be added in updates, but this data will largely remain stable over time.</li>
<li><strong>Clinical Data</strong>: Clinical information (e.g., patient follow-up, treatment protocols, imaging results) will be updated periodically, particularly as new cohorts are enrolled in studies or as follow-up data becomes available from ongoing clinical trials.</li>
<li><strong>Imaging Data</strong>: As new imaging modalities and follow-up imaging scans are collected, this information will be updated regularly. We also plan to include more advanced imaging analysis techniques, including AI-driven insights, in future updates.</li>
